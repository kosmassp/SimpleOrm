# Decisions

ADR-style log. Append an entry whenever a decision in `CLAUDE.md` §7 changes or a new
load-bearing decision is made. Never deviate silently.

## ADR-0001 — Project name and SDK (2026-08-26)

**Decision.** The project is named **SimpleOrm**: solution `SimpleOrm.sln`, packages
`SimpleOrm`, `SimpleOrm.Postgres`, `SimpleOrm.Cli`. The .NET 10 SDK (10.0.400) was
installed and is the build SDK; the core and dialect multi-target
`netstandard2.0;net10.0` as the brief specifies.

**Status.** Accepted.

## ADR-0002 — Local PostgreSQL instead of Testcontainers (2026-08-26)

**Context.** The brief specifies Testcontainers.PostgreSql (real Postgres in Docker)
for integration tests. The development machine has no Docker and the owner decided not
to install it ("no need to have docker").

**Decision.** Integration tests run against a real PostgreSQL server reached through
the `ORM_TEST_CONNECTION` environment variable, defaulting to the machine's local
Laragon PostgreSQL 16.4 (`localhost:5432`, user `postgres`, trust auth). The test
fixture creates the `simpleorm_test` database if it is missing. CI provides a
`postgres:16` service container and sets the same variable. The principle that matters
— **no mocked connections anywhere, every test talks to real Postgres** — is preserved;
only the provisioning mechanism changed.

**Consequences.** Tests are not hermetic on the dev machine (state lives in a shared
local server), so every test must create and drop its own schema objects or use unique
names. If Docker becomes available later, swapping the fixture back to Testcontainers
is a small, isolated change (one fixture class).

**Status.** Accepted.
