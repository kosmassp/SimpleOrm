# Decisions

ADR-style log. Append an entry whenever a decision in `CLAUDE.md` §7 changes or a new
load-bearing decision is made. Never deviate silently.

## ADR-0001 — Project name and SDK (2026-08-26)

**Decision.** The project is named **SimpleOrm**: solution `SimpleOrm.sln`, packages
`SimpleOrm`, `SimpleOrm.Postgres`, `SimpleOrm.Cli`. The .NET 10 SDK (10.0.400) was
installed and is the build SDK; the core and dialect multi-target
`netstandard2.0;net10.0` as the brief specifies.

**Status.** Accepted.

## ADR-0002 — Local PostgreSQL instead of Testcontainers (2026-08-26)

> Superseded by ADR-0003: the reference database is now SQLite and no server is
> needed at all. Kept for history; the "no mocked connections" principle carries over.

**Context.** The brief specifies Testcontainers.PostgreSql (real Postgres in Docker)
for integration tests. The development machine has no Docker and the owner decided not
to install it ("no need to have docker").

**Decision.** Integration tests run against a real PostgreSQL server reached through
the `ORM_TEST_CONNECTION` environment variable, defaulting to the machine's local
Laragon PostgreSQL 16.4 (`localhost:5432`, user `postgres`, trust auth). The test
fixture creates the `simpleorm_test` database if it is missing. CI provides a
`postgres:16` service container and sets the same variable. The principle that matters
— **no mocked connections anywhere, every test talks to real Postgres** — is preserved;
only the provisioning mechanism changed.

**Consequences.** Tests are not hermetic on the dev machine (state lives in a shared
local server), so every test must create and drop its own schema objects or use unique
names. If Docker becomes available later, swapping the fixture back to Testcontainers
is a small, isolated change (one fixture class).

**Status.** Accepted.

## ADR-0003 — SQLite replaces PostgreSQL as the reference database (2026-08-27)

**Context.** The owner decided a running PostgreSQL server is more infrastructure than
this stage of the project warrants ("postgresql is overkill, let's use sqlite for
now"). The tradeoffs were reviewed explicitly before deciding: SQLite is dynamically
typed, has no array parameters, no advisory locks, no date/time types, and no
server-side statement description, all of which shaped Level 1 decisions.

**Decision.** The C# reference implementation targets **SQLite** (via
`Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`) instead of PostgreSQL. The dialect package is
`SimpleOrm.Sqlite`; PostgreSQL moves to the Level 4 "additional dialects" list
(the existing `IDialect` seam is unchanged). CLAUDE.md §7 decisions were reworked
accordingly:

- **IN lists** (§7.12): SQLite has no array parameters, so safe IN-list expansion
  (generated `@p0..@pN` placeholders, always parameterized) is now a **Level 1**
  feature instead of Level 4. The `SupportsArrayParameters` capability flag stays so
  a future Postgres dialect can use `= ANY(@ids)`.
- **Dates** (§7.9): no native date types; the convention is ISO-8601 UTC `TEXT`
  (trailing `Z`), `DateTime.Kind = Utc` only. The `timestamp without time zone` lint
  (`VAL-020`) becomes a lint on non-UTC / non-ISO storage patterns, finalized in
  milestone 4.
- **SchemaGuard** (§7.19): no server describe; SQL is validated by *preparing* the
  statement without executing it. Column type/nullability checks work only for
  table-backed columns; expression columns require nullable properties unless
  annotated. Fixture and migration tables use SQLite **STRICT tables** (3.37+) so
  declared types are actually enforced, preserving "strict by default" as far as
  SQLite allows.
- **Migration locking** (§7.23): advisory locks are replaced by an exclusive write
  transaction (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`) held for the run; the dialect abstracts this as a
  "run lock". SQLite has transactional DDL, so per-migration transactions stay.
- **Generated keys** (§7.14): `RETURNING` is supported (SQLite ≥ 3.35, bundled via
  SQLitePCLraw). The `sequence` key strategy is dropped from Level 1 (SQLite has no
  sequences); database-generated means `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`.
- **Async** (§2): the public API stays async-only with `CancellationToken` (it is the
  spec-level contract ports implement), acknowledging that the SQLite provider is
  synchronous underneath.

**Consequences.** Tests need no server or Docker at all: each fixture is a temp-file
SQLite database, deleted afterwards; `ORM_TEST_CONNECTION` is gone and CI needs no
service container. The Laragon PostgreSQL server started for ADR-0002 was stopped.
Validation guarantees are inherently weaker than Postgres could give; STRICT tables
recover most of it. If a stronger reference is wanted later, Postgres returns as a
Level 4 dialect through the same seam. Supersedes ADR-0002.

**Status.** Accepted.

## ADR-0004 — Attribute mapping is opt-in via [Column] (2026-08-27)

**Context.** Two possible attribute-mapping models: opt-out (every public property is
mapped by convention; `[Ignore]` excludes) or opt-in (only annotated properties are
mapped). The original brief implied opt-out. The owner prefers opt-in: what is mapped
is visible in the model, property by property.

**Decision.** In the attribute loader, a property is mapped **iff it carries
`[Column]`**. The attribute takes an optional name: `[Column("created_at")]` binds
explicitly; bare `[Column]` derives the column name from the property name through
the active naming convention (default snake_case: `UserId` → `user_id`; SQLite
identifiers are case-insensitive, so single-word names also match verbatim).

To preserve "nothing is silent" (CLAUDE.md §2), absence is not allowed to mean
anything: a public settable property with **neither `[Column]` nor `[Ignore]` is a
loader error** (code registered in `spec/errors.md` when the loader lands in
milestone 2). `[Ignore]` therefore stays: it is how a property declares "not a
column" explicitly. The convention loader (for types with no mapping attributes at
all) still maps every public property by convention, and the manual
`EntityMapBuilder<T>` is unchanged — loader precedence explicit → attribute →
convention stays as in §7.2.

**Consequences.** Annotated models are more verbose (every mapped property carries
`[Column]`) but self-documenting, and a forgotten annotation fails fast instead of
silently dropping a column. The sample models are updated accordingly and CLAUDE.md
§7.6 is reworded.

**Status.** Accepted.

## Design seed — read/write splitting and multi-database routing (2026-08-28)

**Context.** The owner proposed a `[Connection]` attribute (per-entity connection
string, read vs. write connections, entities split across databases, potentially
mixed engines such as SQLite + Postgres).

**Decision.** Scheduled for **Level 4**, and when it lands it will be
**session-level, never per-entity**, because:

- `EntityMap` is a conformance artifact describing data shape; a connection name is
  deployment configuration and would make the export environment-dependent.
- `Db` owns one connection and its transaction (§7.17); per-entity connections would
  silently break transaction atomicity. Cross-database work stays two visible
  sessions, two transactions.
- Mixed engines already fall out of the dialect seam: one `Db` per
  (dialect, connection string); which database an entity uses is which session it is
  handed to. Wrong wiring is caught at startup by SchemaGuard, which validates each
  registry against the real schema of the session it is given — so organize queries
  in one registry class per database.

Open question for Level 4: whether the *registry* (not the entity) gets a logical
data-source name for routing/validation ergonomics, and how read-replica routing
expresses read-your-writes consistency explicitly.

**Status.** Deferred to Level 4 (row added to CLAUDE.md §3).
